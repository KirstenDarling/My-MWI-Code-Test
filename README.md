Hello John,

I know you normally deal with Sarah our project manager, however she is currently on vacation and there is some information I'll be needing from you before she returns in order to complete this project for you in a timely manner.

I am needing the final content for the "About Us" page. If you could send over the pictures of the front of your store that we discussed as well as a couple of paragraphs that we can use for a description of your business, I'd appreciate it. I'll need this no later than Wednesday.

If you have any questions or need help with ideas feel free to reach out to me. I'd love to help!

Thank you for your time,<br>
Kirsten Bachert<br>
